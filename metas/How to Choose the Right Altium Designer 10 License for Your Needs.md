## License Types
 
Altium Designer 10 offers three main types of licenses: on-demand, standalone, and private server. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on your situation and preferences.
 
### On-Demand License
 
An on-demand license is a web-based license that allows you to use Altium Designer 10 on any computer without the need to move license files or activate on each machine. You can acquire a seat of an on-demand license by signing in to your Altium account online. There are two modes when using an on-demand license:
 
- On-Demand â a seat of an on-demand license acquired by any client computer, only while you are signed in to your account. When you sign out, the seat is released so that another user can acquire it. Licenses can be centrally pooled for 'use and release' by all designers on your team, or alternatively, licenses can be allocated to defined roles within your company.
- Roaming â a seat of an on-demand license acquired for a specified time. In this mode, you can sign out and work offline, in essence roaming freely with your acquired seat; a temporary standalone license as it were.

An on-demand license is ideal for users who plan to work from multiple machines with an active internet connection. It also provides flexibility to scale up or down the number of seats as needed. However, an on-demand license requires a subscription fee that varies depending on the term length and the features included.
 
### Standalone License
 
A standalone license is a traditional license that allows you to use Altium Designer 10 on a single computer. You need to activate the license using a licensing file (\*.alf) that you can download from your Altium account online. You can also transfer the license to another computer by deactivating it from the current machine and activating it on the new one.
 
A standalone license is ideal for users who work on a dedicated machine and do not need to share the license with others. It also provides ownership of the license without recurring fees. However, a standalone license requires a higher upfront cost than an on-demand license and does not include updates or access to Altium 365 unless you have an active subscription.
 
### Private Server License
 
A private server license is a network-based license that allows you to use Altium Designer 10 on multiple computers within your organization. You need to install and configure a private server (Altium Network License Server) that manages the distribution of licenses to client machines. You can also set up rules and policies for controlling the access and usage of licenses.
 
A private server license is ideal for teams or organizations that need to manage their own licenses without relying on an external server. It also provides security and control over your licenses without needing an internet connection. However, a private server license requires more technical expertise and maintenance than other types of licenses and may not be compatible with some features of Altium 365.
 
## How to Choose
 
To choose the right Altium Designer 10 license for your needs, you need to consider several factors such as:

- Your budget â how much are you willing to spend upfront and over time?
- Your workflow â how often do you switch between machines or work offline?
- Your team size â how many users do you need to share the license with?
- Your features â what capabilities do you need from Altium Designer 10 and Altium 365?
